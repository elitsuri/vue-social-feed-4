## Code Standards

- Keep functions focused and small
- Write self-documenting variable and function names
- Add comments for non-obvious logic only
- Prefer explicit over implicit
- Match the existing code style in the file you are editing

## Reporting Issues

Open an issue with:
- A clear, descriptive title
- Steps to reproduce the problem
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Environment (OS, runtime version, relevant config)
